</a>

I am a senior undergraduate student in Computer Engineering at [Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology](https://hcmut.edu.vn/en/) (HCMUT), currently ranked **#1 in my department** with a GPA of 9.27/10.0. I am applying for PhD programs in **Medical AI** and **Computer Vision** for Fall 2026.

Currently, I work as a Research Assistant at [Xu Lab](https://xulabs.github.io/) (Carnegie Mellon University), advised by [Prof. Min Xu](https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/), and at the [Machine and Hybrid Intelligence Lab](https://www.mhilab.org/) (Northwestern University), advised by [Prof. Ulas Bagci](https://www.mhilab.org/ulas-bagci). My recent work explores Mixture-of-Experts architectures for semi-supervised histopathology segmentation and stain-structure disentanglement for robust pathology analysis.

## Research Vision

My research aims to bridge the gap between advanced computer vision and clinical reality. Specifically, I focus on three interconnected pillars:

    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <div class="card h-100">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h5 class="card-title"><strong>Foundation-Model-Driven Design</strong></h5>
                <p class="card-text">Leveraging large-scale pre-trained models (e.g., SAM) through principled adaptation strategies rather than naive fine-tuning.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <div class="card h-100">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h5 class="card-title"><strong>Mathematically Grounded Modeling</strong></h5>
                <p class="card-text">Building theoretically motivated architectures—including Mixture-of-Experts, disentangled representations, and diffusion models.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <div class="card h-100">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h5 class="card-title"><strong>Learning with Imperfect Annotations</strong></h5>
                <p class="card-text">Developing robust AI systems that operate effectively with limited, noisy, or domain-shifted medical data.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
My goal is to build <strong>robust, generalizable AI systems</strong> for medical imaging that can translate from controlled research environments to the heterogeneous conditions of real-world clinical practice.
